## v0.1.0-alpha — 2026-05-17

### Initial public release

This is the first open-source release of Qorven.

#### Agent platform
- Multi-agent runtime: Prime coordinator + Developer, Researcher, Writer, and Email agents out of the box
- Soul system: rich identity bundles (system prompt + capabilities + behaviour rules) with priority layering
- Setup wizard collects admin account, assistant persona, communication style, language, and first AI provider
- Sub-agent soul generation: agents can write identity prompts for newly created Qors
- Agent dreaming (scheduled reflection), heartbeat probes, and QorOS runtime controls (pause/resume/wakeup)
- Hierarchical memory store backed by pgvector with BM25 full-text search and recency fallback
- Cron job scheduler: per-agent schedules, DB-backed deduplication, human-readable display
- Tool permission system: per-agent profiles with auto-approve / ask-first / blocked policy tiers

#### Channels
- Telegram, WhatsApp (Cloud API), Email (IMAP/SMTP), Slack, Discord, Teams, LINE, Webchat, Webhook
- DingTalk, WeCom, Feishu, Zalo, Facebook, GitHub, SMS, iMessage, Matrix, Mattermost, Signal
- Inbound routing rules, keyword triggers, approval gates, and reply queues

#### Provider support
- Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, xAI, Cerebras, Together, Ollama, OpenRouter
- Smart router: complexity-based tier selection (standard / advanced / code)
- Per-provider encrypted API key vault with test-and-verify flow

#### App platform
- Install Go binary connectors from disk via `POST /v1/apps`
- Enable/disable, reload, and uninstall without restarting the server
- Agents can scaffold and install new connectors at runtime through the agent loop

#### Web dashboard
- `/qors` — agent profiles with Memory, Skills, Metrics, Schedules, Mail, Permissions, and Settings tabs
- `/chat` — streaming chat with tool call display and session history
- `/code` — Code IDE with terminal and file explorer
- `/channels` — channel management with connection status and QR flows
- `/models-hub` — provider key management, model registry browser
- `/approvals` — pending agent action approvals
- `/sessions`, `/mail`, `/contacts`, `/org-chart`, `/audit`, `/settings`
- Danger Zone: selective data resets and factory reset with password confirmation

#### CLI & TUI
- `qorven start` — run the server
- `qorven install` — full-screen BubbleTea TUI installer (PostgreSQL setup, config, migrations, systemd)

- `qorven migrate up/down/force` — database migration management
- `qorven auth login/logout/whoami` — local API authentication
- `qorven agents list/get/create/update/delete` — agent management

#### Infrastructure
- Single baseline migration (`001_schema.up.sql`) — fresh installs run one file
- Embedded migrations in the binary; disk migrations override when present
- Systemd service management, structured logging, `/health` and `/health/detailed` endpoints
- Cross-compile targets: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- Docker Compose for local development (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- GitHub Actions: build + test + release

#### Known limitations at v0.1.0
- Single-node only — no HA or multi-node clustering
- Matrix, Signal, Mattermost, iMessage are scaffolded but not fully wired
- No docs site yet
- Frontend has limited automated test coverage
